"""Two-layer cache for resolved Proton Pass secrets.

* In-process (:data:`_CACHE`): saves repeated fetches WITHIN one process
  (CLI startup, gateway hot-reload, test suites).
* Disk (``<hermes_home>/cache/protonpass_cache.json``, mode 0600 in a 0700
  dir): saves repeated fetches ACROSS processes (scripts, cron, the gateway
  forking new agents).

Both layers store ONLY the secret values plus a token FINGERPRINT (a SHA-256
prefix embedded in the cache key); the token itself is NEVER persisted.  A
``cache_ttl_seconds <= 0`` disables BOTH layers (read and write).
